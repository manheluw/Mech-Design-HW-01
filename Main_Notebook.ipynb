    "This problem took me much longer than expected becasue when I was trying to create my moment diagram, I realized that i shear diagram was incorrect.  The problem I first had was mixing up R1 and R2, and the second problem I encountered was writing down the wrong value for one of the peaks in my shear diagram. Once I fixed it, making the shear diagram then actually made sense. The area under the shear diagram coorisponds with the values of the moment diagram and the slopes of the moment diagram coorispond with the values on the shear diagram. And they both start and end at 0 and alogn with the forces acting on the free body diagam, the units all worked out. There for we can see that we came to the right answer."

    "I had a lot of fun with this problem when I started it, but it was time consuming. I used the height of the woman to determine the length of the beam and where the forces are being applied and the lengths looked reasonable, and the units make sense. I kept everything in imperial to stick with the given max capacity force in pounds. All of the forces make sense and work out mathematically. The joint must provide more force than that hoist because it has a shorter lever arm to the piston. And the most force is on the piston because it has to support both loads, with the joint turning out to have a downwards force. In part b the answer does seem very small but when you think about it, usually square metal tubes are pretty thin, and the metal that we are using is very strong, it has a yield strength of 655 MPa, when most metals don't even have a tensile strength of that much. Otherwise the units all make sense when I converted feet to inches in the bending stress equation. Overall I believe I did this problem correctly."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, **everything fails, no questions asked**. The bottom bolts actually experience the highest stress due to the massive overturning moment from the horizontal cable force acting on a 3m moment arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, if the elevator fell for 16 seconds at 4 m/s² acceleration and stopped in only 1/3 of a meter:\n",
    "1. The cable would snap instantly (24x over capacity)\n",
    "2. The top bolt would shear off (12x over capacity)  \n",
    "3. The bottom bolts would rip out of the building (570x over capacity from the moment!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie physics are... generous. This is what being a mechanical engineer is all about — analyzing fake representations of reality in movie scenes that were created before I was even born!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was a fun exercise in applying real engineering principles to Hollywood physics. The key insights were:\n",
    "1. **Dynamic loading matters** — the impact force is far greater than static weight\n",
    "2. **Moment effects dominate** — the overturning moment on the bottom bolts creates stresses far exceeding direct shear\n",
    "3. **Shear ≠ Tensile strength** — using the correct failure criterion is critical\n",
    "4. **Movies aren't real** — but analyzing them is educational!"
